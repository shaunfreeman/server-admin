It does not do these:

CTRL C	- Copy text
CTRL V	- Paste text

This editbox uses CTRL/V as a literal-next character.  You
can enter TAB characters by first pressing CTRL/V then TAB. This
example contains a few tab characters.

It supports the mouse - but only for positioning in the editbox,
or for clicking on buttons.  Your terminal (emulator) may support
cut/paste.
